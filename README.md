# AOC 2023

My code solutions to Advent of Code for 2023.

To run:

- normally: `bun test`
- with watching: `bun --watch test` or `bun test --watch`
- a specific day: `bun test 01`
- a specific part: `bun test b` (why?)
- a specific part of a specific day: `bun test 01/b` (a space instead of / will act like an "OR" operator)
- with full input testing: `AOC_RUN_FULL=1 bun test`

(you can combine these things)

Also please ignore some part "a"'s failing the tests, since some part "b"'s have different example inputs and i haven't updated the code to allow for that
